# Smart Debt Payoff Optimizer

An AI-powered financial tool that helps users create personalized debt paydown plans using machine learning and statistical analysis.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicts optimal payment amounts using Random Forest algorithms
- **Multiple Strategies**: Compares Debt Avalanche, Snowball, and ML-Optimized approaches  
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes debt-to-income ratios, credit utilization, and payment efficiency
- **Statistical Insights**: Provides detailed financial profiling and recommendations
- **Scalable Database**: Handles multiple users with complex debt portfolios

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Demographics, income, credit scores, employment status
- **Debt Accounts**: Multiple debt types with interest rates and balances
- **Transactions**: Historical payment and charge records
- **Budget Categories**: Spending patterns and category analysis
- **Recommendations**: AI-generated payoff strategies

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Feature Engineering**: Creates financial ratios and derived metrics
2. **Model Training**: Random Forest for payment prediction
3. **Strategy Optimization**: Compares multiple payoff approaches
4. **Performance Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics

### Key Algorithms
- **Debt Avalanche**: Prioritizes highest interest rate debts
- **Debt Snowball**: Targets smallest balances first  
- **ML-Optimized**: AI-driven strategy considering multiple factors

## Usage

```python
# Initialize the application
app = SmartDebtPayoffOptimizer()
